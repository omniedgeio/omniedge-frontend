# Comparisions

## OmniEdge Vs VPN

### 1. What is the difference between OmniEdge and VPNs?

A **virtual private network (VPN)** extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. There is always a VPN server that provides such services. The Users connect to the server and are replayed by the server. 

**OmniEdge** doesn't need any central Sever, which creates a peer-to-peer tunnel between two nodes, builds a virtual network for all the devices which connect to each other. 

### 2. Benefits of OmniEdge vs. VPNs,dVPNs, Blockchain VPNs

With OmniEdge, you: 

- Don't need any VPN server anymore.
- Don't need any VPN gateway for your company's different branches. 
- OmniEdge provide a peer-to-peer connection between devices without server relay, while VPN always reley on your connections.

## OmniEdge Vs frp/ngrok

ngrok/frp is a reverse proxy tool used for exposing your local service to the public, let you access your computer's localhost from a mobile device for example. ngrok is a free/paid service. The free service has limitations of requests per minute and only one tunnel at a time. frp is an open-source version of ngrok. 

### The big difference

- Ngrok/frp is limited to TCP webservice only, and you need to set each service before using it.

- OmniEdge is not limited to TCP and covers all the TCP and UDP services, you can access your own devices only by one fixed IP. 

Let's compare some use cases between ngrok/frp and omniedge.

|Use Cases|ngrok/frp|OmniEdge|
|--|--|--|
|**Expose local web service**|`ngrok tcp 3000` then use a public IP like: `https://greatlocalservice.ngrok.io:5565` | `http://100.100.1.1:3000`|
|**SSH**| 22 is your ssh port and 11111 is the reversed port by ngrok `ngrok tcp 22 && ssh admin@greatlocalservice.ngrok.io -p 11111` | `ssh admin@100.100.1.1` |
|**RDP**| `ngrok tcp 3389` and use `greatlocalservice.ngrok.io:15678` for RDP address | Just put the omniedge IP `100.100.1.1` into the RDP Client|
|**FTP**| `ngrok tcp 21 && ftp://greatlocalservice.ngrok.io:8877` | `ftp://100.100.1.1` |
|**VNC**|`ngrok tcp 5900` and use the `greatlocalservice.ngrok.io:9988` as the VNC address |just put the OmniEdge IP `100.100.1.1` into the VNC client|

### Security

|Accessiable|ngrok/frp|OmniEdge|

|Accessiable Limitation|Manually IP whitelisting setting with paid plan|Private automatically|

## OmniEdge Vs n2n

n2n is a light VPN software which makes it easy to create virtual networks bypassing intermediate firewalls. The current OmniEdge is built on top of n2n and we think very high of it. We open source the package with use from n2n, you can found it [here](https://omniedge.io/docs/article/Opensource).

```
An OmniEdge protocol is under developing with OmniEdge's design, which takes the advantages from a lot of p2p protocls including n2n. However, all the features mentioned here will be kept.
```

We designed OmniEdge to make it easier to use p2p connectiong with n2n to secure your network connections. You can choose to use n2n directly, without OmniEdge. 

### Setup

n2n provides two tools to use to make a connection between two nodes. The first is `edge` for nodes, and the other is the `supernode` for the server, and both are necessary. By simply install the n2n package for your linux distributon, you can easily setup up by running the command. To connect two devices, you have to install `edge` on each device, create a network name, generate keys, define IPs for each device. You need to remember all of them for next time use, or you can write into a conf file for each device. The conigraution file includes the information about the device, such as: network name, secrect key, IP address, supernode address, and you need to create the similar file for the other device. Every devices need such a conf file to make a connection, so the number of configuration files grows incredibley in the number of devices, which also make it harder to manage. 

To connect devices using OmniEdge, you just need to log in to OmniEdge on each device, with GUI apps for [windows](/download/windows)ï¼Œ[android](/download/windows),[iOS]() or command cli for [linux](/download/linuxcli), [macOS](/download/macos),[Synology](/download/synology),[Raspberry Pi](/download/rasp), [ARM based Hardware](/download/embedded), [Nvidia Machine Learning Hardware](/download/nvidia). For command cli for all above, you can also run a simple command `curl https://omniedge.io/install/omniedge-install.sh | bash` to install omniedge cli. OmniEdge manages network name, secret key, IP address and all configrautions for you, you can also have a dashboard to manage all your devices, virtual networks and security keys. This is very helpful not only for non-technical users, but technical users to save time. 

### Bonus features

OmniEdge builds a lot of features to improve the connection with n2n. OmniEdge offers the multi virtual network control panel, users can set different IP ranges or same IP ranges for different purpose, or sharing with your virutal netowrk to allow other users to join to have access. For users who need more security, high speed and low lantency, a [custom supernode](/docs#6-customize-supernode) is also avaviable. There are also a security key feature to help login quickly for cli, a device panel to remove or rename to make managment easily. For enterprise users, we can also offer okta, microsoft or other integration authenications. And more features will be developed in the future.
